      About Me
    </h1>
    <span>
      I'm a passionate individual with a love for programming, sports, and music. I thrive on constantly learning and pushing my boundaries, always eager to grow and improve. I am confident that
      my strong work ethic and positive attitude will serve me well in any
      professional setting.

      In my free time, I enjoy staying active by playing tennis and basketball, swimming, and exploring nature through hiking. Music is also a significant part of my life, providing both relaxation and inspiration.

      On the technical side, I have experience working with a variety of technologies. I am proficient in Java, TypeScript and Vue.js. I have hands-on experience with AWS for cloud computing and PostgreSQL for database management.
      I have acquired AWS Cloud Practitioner Certificate in 2023. I have also worked with Node.js and JavaScript. I am always eager to learn new technologies and expand my skill set.
